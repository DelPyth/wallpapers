# Multi-monitor Wallpapers
Wallpapers that are split into different images. You can choose these individual images for all of your wallpapers, or simply choose them for each monitor.
Wallpapers here are put into folders as groups so they don't get lost.
Yes, I know there are multi-monitor wallpapers in the other folders, but this is for grouped wallpapers.

## Setup
(Windows):
1. Go to Windows Settings > Personalization > Background.
2. Under "Choose Your Picture," right click a background image you've previously chosen and select "Set for Monitor X" where "X" is the monitor you'd like to change.
3. Repeat for other monitors.
