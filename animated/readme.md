# Animated
This is just a folder containing animated wallpapers. Remember to check your operating system to see if you can use animated wallpapers.

# Windows
Windows is known for not allowing animations, but still allowing GIF file formats for your wallpapers. If you would like to use animations for your wallpapers, I recommend using one of the following:
- Wallpaper Engine
- Stardock DeskScapes 10
- PUSH Video Wallpaper
- Rainmeter
- Plastuer
