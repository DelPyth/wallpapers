# Wallpapers
These are just all my wallpapers I've collected so far.

## Why not DropBox or Drive?
Too lazy, plus I can directly upload changes and new files using Git anyway.

## How do I download it?
Just click the `Code` button and click `Download ZIP` and you've got everything.

## Can I submit my own?
Sure, just submit a request in `Issues` with the correct tags and you're good to go.
